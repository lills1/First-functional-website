# First-functional-website

For this project I was required to make the first ever version of my portfolio! This was achieved using a variety of techniques i've learned including flex boxes, media query's, as well as my foundational knowledge of semantic html, to create this site! Building this from scratch was challenging, but it paid off in the end when the code funcitoned how i wanted it to. Here is the link to access the website: https://lills1.github.io/First-functional-website/
